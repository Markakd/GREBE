Specialized Needs Annexes
*************************

Ada 95, Ada 2005, and Ada 2012 define a number of Specialized Needs Annexes, which are not
required in all implementations.  However, as described in this chapter,
GNAT implements all of these annexes:

*Systems Programming (Annex C)*
  The Systems Programming Annex is fully implemented.


*Real-Time Systems (Annex D)*
  The Real-Time Systems Annex is fully implemented.


*Distributed Systems (Annex E)*
  Stub generation is fully implemented in the GNAT compiler.  In addition,
  a complete compatible PCS is available as part of the GLADE system,
  a separate product.  When the two
  products are used in conjunction, this annex is fully implemented.


*Information Systems (Annex F)*
  The Information Systems annex is fully implemented.


*Numerics (Annex G)*
  The Numerics Annex is fully implemented.


*Safety and Security / High-Integrity Systems (Annex H)*
  The Safety and Security Annex (termed the High-Integrity Systems Annex
  in Ada 2005) is fully implemented.
