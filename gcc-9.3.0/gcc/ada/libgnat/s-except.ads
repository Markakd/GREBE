   --  a body for this package.
   --
   --  We do this because this unit used to have a body in earlier versions
   --  of GNAT, and it causes various bootstrap path problems etc if we remove
   --  a body, since we may pick up old unwanted bodies.
   --
   --  Note: we use this standard Ada method of requiring a body rather
   --  than the cleaner pragma No_Body because System.Exceptions is a compiler
   --  unit, and older bootstrap compilers do not support pragma No_Body. This
   --  type can be removed, and s-except.adb can be replaced by a source
   --  containing just that pragma, when we decide to move to a 2008 compiler
   --  as the minimal bootstrap compiler version. ???
