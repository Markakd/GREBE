mhard-div
Target RejectNegative InverseMask(SOFT_DIV)
Use hardware divide instructions, use -msoft-div for emulation.

mhard-mul
Target RejectNegative InverseMask(SOFT_MUL).
Use hardware multiply instructions, use -msoft-mul for emulation.

mcmov
Target RejectNegative Mask(CMOV)
Allows generation of binaries which use the l.cmov instruction.  If your target
does not support this the compiler will generate the equivalent using set and
branch.

mror
Target RejectNegative Mask(ROR)
Allows generation of binaries which use the l.rori instructions.

msext
Target RejectNegative Mask(SEXT)
Allows generation of binaries which use sign-extension instructions.  If your
target does not support this the compiler will use memory loads to perform sign
extension.

msfimm
Target RejectNegative Mask(SFIMM)
Allows generation of binaries which use l.sf*i instructions.  If your target
does not support this the compiler will generate instructions to store the
immediate to a register first.

mshftimm
Target RejectNegative Mask(SHFTIMM)
Allows generation of binaries which support shifts and rotate instructions
supporting immediate arguments, for example l.rori.

msoft-div
Target RejectNegative Mask(SOFT_DIV)
Use divide emulation.

msoft-mul
Target RejectNegative Mask(SOFT_MUL).
Use multiply emulation.
