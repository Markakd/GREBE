BRIG (HSAIL) frontend test cases
--------------------------------

The suite consists of "smoke tests" that test several features of
the compilation and regression tests, but is not an exhaustive test
suite for all HSAIL instructions. The HSA PRM conformance suite
is supposed to be used for that.

HSAILasm is required for converting the text HSAIL files to BRIGs
which the compiler consumes. It can be built from
