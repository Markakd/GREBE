These are my testcases in DejaGnu format.

The tests which have "passed" in the groups variable do actually pass
on my local G++ so if there is a specific "passed" test you'd like to
see working in your version of G++ but it doesn't pass, contact me and
I'll dig up the specific patches you'll need.

I have about a hundred or so unsorted testcases which are not
included in this archive, due to lack of time and boredom stemming
from writing .exp-files.  But they will show up eventually.

All these files, and this file are Copyright FSF 1993, 2007 and fall
under the GPL version 3 or later.
