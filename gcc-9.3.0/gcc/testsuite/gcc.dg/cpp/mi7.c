/* Test "ignore redundant include" facility.

   -H is used because cpp might confuse the issue by optimizing out
   #line markers.  This test only passes if the headers is read
   twice.

   The disgusting regexp in the dg-error line, when stuck into
   dg.exp's compiler-output regexp, matches the correct -H output and
   only the correct -H output.  It has to be all on one line because
   otherwise it will not be interpreted all in one unit.  */
