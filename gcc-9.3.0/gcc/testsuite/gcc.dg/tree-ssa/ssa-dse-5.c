   There's two outputs which would indicate that the optimization was

   If we used block copying to detect and eliminate the partially dead
   store, then we should see an assignment "i = 5" somewhere in the
   dump file.

   Another approach would be to redirect the path from the true arm
   of the first conditional so that it reaches the statement *p = 5
