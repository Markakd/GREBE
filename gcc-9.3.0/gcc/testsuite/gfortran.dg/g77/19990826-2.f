* Here is a slightly simpler and neater test case

      program labug3
      implicit none

*  This program gives the wrong answer on mips-sgi-irix6.5
*  when compiled with g77 from egcs-19990629 (gcc 2.95 prerelease)
*  Get a = 0.0 when it should be 1.0 
*
*  Works with:  -femulate-complex
*               egcs-1.1.2 
*
*  Originally derived from LAPACK 3.0 test suite.

      one = (1.,0.)
      a = f1(one) 
      if ( abs(a-1.0) .gt. 1.0e-5 ) then
