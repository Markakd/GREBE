* Subject: g77 bug in assign
* 
* I found some files in the NCAR graphics source code which used to
* compile with g77 and now don't.  All contain the following combination
* of "save" and "assign".  It fails on a Sun running SunOS 4.1.3 and a
* Sun running SunOS 5.5 (slightly older g77), but compiles on an
* IBM/RS6000:
* 
C
      SUBROUTINE QUICK
      SAVE
C
      ASSIGN 101 TO JUMP ! { dg-warning "Deleted feature: ASSIGN" }
  101 Continue
C
      RETURN
      END
* 
* Everything else in the NCAR distribution compiled, including quite a
* few C routines.
