This directory is an exact copy (except for this file) of the Go
testsuite from the test subdirectory of http://code.google.com/p/go.
This is here so that we run the same tests as the gc Go compiler.  We
do not, however, run the tests in the same way.  The gc compiler uses
the run shell script in this directory.  For gccgo, we use the file
go-test.exp in the parent directory to run the tests in gcc's usual
DejaGNU test harness.
